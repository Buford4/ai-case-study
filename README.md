# Case Study: Artificial Intelligence and Property Tech with Ylopo
## Overview and Origin
* Ylopo LLC was founded by Juefeng Ge CPO/CMO and Howard Tager CEO in 2016 with an incubation period beginning in 2013. Ylopo is funded by private equity, venture capital, and institutional investors with at least two funding rounds.

## Business Activities
* One of the main hurdles in being a real estate agent is rounding up clients. Up until recently “Lead Generation” consisted of cold calling people, door knocking, and holding something like a trivia night at the local watering hole. This is not to say that those things do not work, they are just outdated. Have you ever been cold-called by a realtor? I am personally in a group of people who do not answer a number that I do not have saved. No text message? No voicemail? No dice. My personal favorite is when I receive a call from a number in New York and decline it and then they call back immediately from a number in Florida, then California, then Toronto. It is hard to meet potential qualified clients like this these days. Lead generation has a new friend; Ylopo and AI.

* It is obvious that the company’s intended customer is the realtor, but what I am seeing is the unintended customer: the clients. I’ve been on both sides of the coin. When an agent or broker is operating efficiently the transaction and all that the transaction entails will be barely noticed by the client. When an agent or broker is operating inefficiently the inefficiencies will be both noticed and felt by the clients throughout the transaction. Ylopo’s platform has artificial intelligence built into the package for agents and brokers. 

Products Offered and Technologies that are being implemented are as follows:

* Lead Generation - Ylopo uses two marketing channels to generate leads: a PPC ad on social media and a PPC ad on Google. High-intent leads are targeted with the use of dynamic ads, IDX feeds, and Google search ads.

* Lead Nurture - Ylopo claims to re-engage 30% of dormant leads through follow-ups with email listing campaigns. If the search behavior of the leads begins to look more frequent, the Lead Nurture will notify the agent or broker that it is a good time to contact the potential client again. A chatbot is used for automatic follow-ups.

* RAIya - Text + Voice (A.I. Powered ISA) - RAIya text and voice is a feature that separates Ylopo from its competitors. They have real-life examples of both the AI text feature and the AI voice feature on their site. The reviews on both seem to be positive. The AI voice feature… you need to visit Ylopo’s homepage and listen to this conversation with a potential lead. It is astonishing and I was blown away at how organic this conversation felt. It is beautiful. Ylopo also creates dynamic video leads automatically, does the re-marketing for potential clients that have fallen “cold”, and can also send the MLSs needed to Facebook allowing potential clients to search homes listed on the MLS on Ylopo’s platform.

* IDX Home Search - This is typical for real estate marketing suites.

* DYVA - Dynamic Video Ads

* CRM Integration - Ylopo looks like a CRM at first glance, but they are not, technically speaking. Ylopo integrates third-party CRM providers that are selected by Ylopo so there are no interruptions in work or work flow. Ylopo then utilizes AI to analyze your prospects’ behavior through your platform. The current CRMs’ include Follow Up Boss, Sierra Interactive, Firepoint, Chime, and Liondesk. Partially integrated CRMs include Cinc, Contactually, Salesforce, and Boomtown.

* Mission Control - This is Ylopo’s central dashboard. Within this dashboard is an auto-pilot feature, which means that the Ylopo platform is doing a large amount of work for the agent or broker. The agent or broker can also opt out of the feature and complete these tasks on their own. There are features for ad run and ad spending with location and demographic controls. The dashboard also includes detailed marketing performance and social engagement monitoring.

* Branded Website - The customer can have their own branded website, choosing from 5 customizable templates. This website will host the IDX as well as integrated Zillow reviews.

* Listing Rocket - When an agent or broker lists a property for sale, this feature automatically detects the listing and generates a Facebook Lead Ad campaign with the entire process being synced with the agent or broker’s MLS. If the property listing switches from “Active” to “Under Contract” the Listing Rocket detects the change and then promotes the change. The Listing Rocket generates seller reports and campaign reports as well.

* Homebot

* CRM Masterclass

* Lead Conversion Masterclass

## Landscape
* Ylopo operates in the Digital Marketing Industry geared solely towards real estate agents and brokers and property search dynamics. So Ylopo operates in two different industries: Digital Marketing and Property Technology (PropTech). The real estate industry has been at a slow steady crawl as far as implementing tech into the industry goes. The biggest innovations before this last decade were companies like Zillow and Redfin. These two companies integrated all of the MLSs for the U.S. into one user-friendly platform. This has increased the quantity of home buying in the U.S. for both investors and families looking to move into their first home. Another innovative move in the real estate industry in the past decade was the introduction of CRMs, allowing agents and brokers to track client interest and activity as well as having a landing page for lead generation. 
## Results
* The impact that Ylopo has had on the real estate lead generation business is still being measured due to the fact that Ylopo has only been on the scene for a few years. The reviews and testimonials suggest that the customers (agents) are seeing a definite increase in cold clients turning into actual clients as well as a percentage increase in sales volume and commission.
## Recommendations
* If I were to be an advisor to Ylopo I would advise them to market themselves as only and 
AI Lead Generation tool that can be integrated with your CRM. The cost to the customer (agents and brokers) would be reduced drastically. The AI Text and Voice being the only product that Ylopo would provide would allow for continued innovation on AI and machine learning rather than a dynamic one-stop-shop marketing platform… There are already many of these in circulation. Set yourself apart from the competition and cut the fat off. The technologies that would be used in this situation would be less than Ylopo’s current use. Only focusing on AI implementation, therefore using and producing AI tech. Again, there are many all-in-one marketing suites available, and that technology already exists. Let us try something new and innovative.
