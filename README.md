# Case Study: Artificial Intelligence and Property Tech with Ylopo
"I've never seen more change happening more quickly than right now in Real Estate. I’ve never seen more really big, well-funded companies coming into the space and looking to disrupt the industry and disintermediate the traditional agent-consumer relationship. Our core mission at Ylopo is to empower real estate agents to win and win big with the most advanced digital marketing technologies that even the big new players wish they had!" 


Howard Tager CEO Ylopo
## Overview and Origin
After selling Tiger Leads to realtor.com in 2013 (2007 - 2013), Ylopo was founded by Howard Tager CEO, and Juefeng Ge CMO/CPO with Ylopo’s official launch in 2016. Howard Tager tells us that the rest of the founding group is a mix of talent from technologists to engineers putting tech at the forefront of Ylopo’s business strategy. Howard Tagar explains that Ylopo wanted to provide what seems to be an all-in-one digital marketing suite for realtors so they can focus on the clients and transactions solely without needing to become fluent in the space of digital marketing.

Ylopo's funding is through private equity, venture capital, institutional investors. Ylopo has completed two rounds of funding. The first round of funding was in 2014 for $1,000,000.00. The second and last round of funding was in 2020 for $5,000,000.00, totaling around $6,000,000.00 of funding over all. Ylopo’s revenue is in-between $50,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00, with Ylopo's growth expected to increase and continue.

## Business Activities
On Ylopo’s site, an expression of their mission is stated: “Ylopo is a next-generation technology platform that helps real estate brokers, agents, and teams grow and manage their business by being their all-in-one digital hub to generate new customers, nurture their existing prospects, manage their team, and build their brand”. What specific problem is Ylopo working to solve? Inefficiency in agents’ workflow. Agents, brokers, and teams are their intended customers and the company seems to be gaining traction in the real estate digital marketing and lead generation industry. 

Market Size. According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), there are upwards of 1,500,000 Realtors (Registered with NAR not counting agents who are not members) in the U.S.. This is quite the market to pull from. There are fees and pricing structures for agents to choose from. The start-up and onboarding fee hovers around $1,500.00. There is a branded website-only package at $345.00 per month. This package offers a website for personal business branding and a website for lead generation. The other package that is offered costs $545.00 per month and is a full lead generation package. 

The full lead generation package/suite looks to have a good ROI. Within this suite are what seems to be a slew of technologies at the agent's disposal. It is important to point out that Ylopo is not a CRM itself, but a platform that integrates with customers' personal CRM. Ylopo has partnered with a small group of CRMs for seamless integration into their platform. Ylopo has also partnered with other CRMs for partial integration into their platform. There are a few competitors with the top two competitors being Real Geeks and Cinc. Cinc is also a partially integrated CRM with Ylopo’s platform. It seems that Ylopo has an advantage over the competition with not only the integration of artificial intelligence but also Ylopo’s markets themselves heavily to their customers.

Ylopo sets itself apart from the competition with a few different modalities that are built into its all-in-one dynamic digital marketing platform. The full list of Ylopo’s products includes Lead Generation, Lead Nurture, RAIya - Text + Voice, IDX Home Search, DYVA - Dynamic Video Ads, CRM Integration, Mission Control (Their dashboard), Branded Website, and Listing Rocket. Lead Generation, Lead Nurture, RAIya, and Listing Rocket are the products that utilize artificial intelligence. The lead generation feature uses a messaging bot to reach out to prospects through their “cutting-edge” Facebook marketing ads. Lead nurture sends SMS messages to already logged prospects who have fallen off of their home search. Lead nurture, with the help of AI, reaches out to a prospect when the AI detects that the old prospect has begun to search for homes again through the agent's IDX home search product. If lead nurture reaches out, and the prospect is interested in speaking with an agent RAIya enters the equation. The RAIya product is an AI real estate assistant claims Ylopo. With both a text and a voice feature, RAIya will reach out to the prospect to determine whether they are a qualified and eager buyer/seller or if they are just looking around. The text feature is great, but the voice feature is even better. Ylopo has a preview of RAIya voice and RAIya text that you can investigate <a href=https://www.ylopo.com/raiya-1>here.<a/>

## Landscape
Ylopo thrives in the digital marketing space as well as in the property technologies space in the past decade or so, the real estate agent industry has not really integrated tech into their daily lives. The most noteworthy event to bless the real estate industry was the multiple listing services (MLS). Other than that, companies like Zillow and Redfin have combined all of the MLS services within the U.S. to gain a farther reach for prospects. Agents pay these companies a monthly fee or buy an area code within their own market. Purchasing an area code costs customers some big bucks as the market for this situation is saturated. Digital marketing has obviously been a player in real estate sales and closings, but cold calling and door knocking were still being pushed on agents to find clients. I think it is safe to say that these days, a large percentage of Americans do not answer phone numbers they do not know or have saved. As stated earlier in the case study, there two competitors for Ylopo or at least on their level. Real Geeks and Cinc. Once again, I want to mention that Cinc is a partially integrated CRM with Ylopo. Real Geeks is a true competitor as they offer similar products and services at competitive rates in comparison with Ylopo’s rates and Real Geeks has implemented AI as the foundation of their business and products offered. Real Geeks also has their own CRM platform in opposition to Ylopo’s CRM integration strategies. 

## Results
Ylopo has had quite an impact thus far. Ylopo's competitors are beginning to lose customers as they shift from their current CRM or integrate their  CRMs into the Ylopo platform. The infographic on Built With’s site https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/Ylopo/Market-Share shows Ylopo’s customer base and market share. Competitors like ListTrac and Boomtown ROI are steadily losing customers to Ylopo. Real Geeks, one of the main competitors stated earlier in this case study, has lost quite a few customers to Ylopo. Ylopo is gaining market share as it seems to be at the beginning of outperforming the competition. 

The core metrics that these companies in this industry use to measure the success of their products and services are namely closed transactions and sales volume via CRM platforms. The data from a prospect and all the way to a closed transaction is tracked through these dashboards and logged in real-time.  

“Introducing RAIYA Voice, the cutting-edge AI tool that empowers real estate agents to convert leads like never before. Designed exclusively for real estate agents,RAIYA Voice will become your secret weapon to unlock more conversions, free up precious time, and maximize the potential of every new lead you generate".  This is a quote from Ylopo’s site with a half hour video where the founders take a deep dive into RAIya voice. The implementation of AI into there platform is helping Ylopo to truly gain a competitive edge in the field. It is stated that the rate of improvement with RAIya is high as the AI is learning at an exponential pace. 
## Recommendations
The only recommendation that I would have for Ylopo would be to focus as much energy on moving their AI forward as possible. Again, the implementation of AI within their platform is a game changer. Ylopo’s ability to integrate other CRMs into their platform is a big deal, but the industry needs more focus on the abilities of artificial intelligence for the future. I hate to say this, but most of what a realtor, real estate agent, and broker do in their daily work lives will be accomplished by artificial intelligence in some way in the near future. Focusing on what else AI can do in this industry is of importance.
